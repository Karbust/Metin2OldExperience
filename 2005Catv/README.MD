# 2005 Client files

| File | Desc |
| :---: | :-----: |
patch.ver | Surprisingly the version of this client is reported 0.0.4.7 |
| local.add | What I suspect is another IP for patching? |
| MD5.txt | This refers to an md5, possibly the client executable or the setup |
| patch.add | Multiple patch addresses, none of this looks online, maybe patchmetin? |
| patch.cfg | Reference of the old metin website (before yt2.catv.net) configured for the splash in the autopatcher |
