# LegacyMetin2Emulator
This is an old version of a Metin2 emulator written in C# that
does support a patched 2005 Chinese CBT client.

You need both metin2bin_no_hackshield_enable_logfile.1337
and metin2bin_patch_nomyevankey.1337 to work.

It's currently unlicensed as I haven't decided a license yet,
feel free to drop an issue or send a PR if you are interested.

It uses an older version of [CsLibBase](https://github.com/arves100/CsLibBase)
that was never released to the public.

I suggest you looking at QuantumCore if you need a maintained server
emulator with more features.
It might get a 2005 support just for the fun in the future.
